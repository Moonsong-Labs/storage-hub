//! # Storage Providers Pallet
//!
//! This pallet provides the functionality to manage Main Storage Providers (MSPs)
//! and Backup Storage Providers (BSPs) in a decentralized storage network.
//!
//! The functionality allows users to sign up and sign off as MSPs or BSPs and change
//! their parameters. This is the way that users can offer their storage capacity to
//! the network and get rewarded for it.
