//! # Randomness Pallet
//!
//! This pallet provides access to randomness using as source the relay chain BABE one epoch ago randomness,
//! produced by the relay chain per relay chain epoch
//!
//! There are no extrinsics for this pallet. Instead, an inherent updates the pseudo-random word obtained from
//! the relay chain when an epoch changes, and that word can be then used by other pallets as a source of randomness
//! as this pallet implements the Randomness trait
//!
//! ## Babe Epoch Randomness
//! Babe epoch randomness is retrieved once every relay chain epoch.
//!
//! The `set_babe_randomness` mandatory inherent reads the Babe epoch randomness from the
//! relay chain state proof and updates the latest pseudo-random word with this epoch randomness.
//!
//! `Config::BabeDataGetter` is responsible for reading the epoch index and epoch randomness
//! from the relay chain state proof
