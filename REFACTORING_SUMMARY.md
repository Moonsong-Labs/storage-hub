# Remote File Handler Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. FTP Handler (`client/rpc/src/remote_file/ftp.rs`)
- Added fields to store parsed URL components:
  ```rust
  pub struct FtpFileHandler {
      config: RemoteFileConfig,
      host: String,
      port: u16,
      username: Option<String>,
      password: Option<String>,
      path: String,
  }
  ```
- Updated constructor to parse URL once and store components
- Modified all methods to use stored fields instead of parsing URL on each call
- Removed URL parameter from internal methods like `connect()`, `download()`, `upload()`

### 2. HTTP Handler (`client/rpc/src/remote_file/http.rs`)
- Added field to store the base URL:
  ```rust
  pub struct HttpFileHandler {
      client: Client,
      config: RemoteFileConfig,
      base_url: Url,
  }
  ```
- Updated constructor to store the URL
- Modified methods to use `self.base_url` instead of URL parameter
- Kept URL parameter in `upload_file()` to allow different authentication

### 3. Local File Handler (`client/rpc/src/remote_file/local.rs`)
- Added field to store the parsed file path:
  ```rust
  pub struct LocalFileHandler {
      file_path: PathBuf,
  }
  ```
- Updated constructor to parse URL to path once
- Modified methods to use `self.file_path` instead of parsing URL
- Kept URL parameter in `upload_file()` to allow uploading to different paths

### 4. Factory (`client/rpc/src/remote_file/factory.rs`)
- Updated to pass URL to all handler constructors
- Each handler now requires URL at construction time

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: URL parsing happens only once during handler creation instead of on every method call
2. **Efficiency**: Reduced redundant parsing operations, especially beneficial for handlers that make multiple operations
3. **Cleaner Code**: Methods are simpler and focused on their core functionality
4. **Type Safety**: URL validation happens at construction time

## Test Updates

All test code was updated to:
- Pass URL when creating handlers
- Access public fields for assertions where appropriate
- Maintain the same test coverage and behavior
