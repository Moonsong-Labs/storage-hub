### Steps

1. **Fix Import Organization Across All Remote File Modules**

   - File: `client/rpc/src/remote_file/ftp.rs`
   - Operation: Reorganize imports at lines 1-15 and fix inline imports at lines 218, 290
   - Details: 
     ```rust
     // External crates first
     use async_trait::async_trait;
     use bytes::Bytes;
     use futures::Stream;
     use std::pin::Pin;
     use suppaftp::{AsyncFtpStream, FtpError};
     use tokio::io::{AsyncRead, AsyncReadExt};
     use url::Url;
     
     // Local imports after blank line
     use super::{RemoteFileError, RemoteFileHandler};
     ```
   - Success: All imports properly organized with external crates first, then local imports

   - File: `client/rpc/src/remote_file/http.rs`
   - Operation: Apply same import organization pattern

     ```rust
     // Replace: let mut chunk = vec![0u8; FILE_CHUNK_SIZE as usize];
     // With: let mut chunk = Vec::with_capacity(FILE_CHUNK_SIZE as usize);
     ```
   - Success: Memory allocation without unnecessary zero initialization

   - File: `client/rpc/src/remote_file/ftp.rs`
   - Operation: Replace vec! at line 219 and line 280

   - File: `client/rpc/src/lib.rs`
   - Operation: Restore all removed explanatory comments
   - Details:
     ```rust
     // Line ~331: Add back "// Check if the execution is safe."
     // Line ~334: Add back "// Open file in the local file system."
     // Line ~340: Add back "// Instantiate an "empty" [`FileDataTrie`] so we can write the file chunks into it."
     // Line ~342: Add back "// A chunk id is simply an integer index."
     // Line ~351: Add back "// Reached EOF, break loop."
     // Line ~355: Add back "// Haven't reached EOF yet, continue loop."

     // Line ~499: Add back "// Write file data to disk."
     ```
   - Success: All useful documentation comments restored

4. **Improve Test Structure and Assertions**

   - File: `client/rpc/src/tests/remote_file_rpc_tests.rs`
   - Operation: Update test assertions to check specific error types
   - Details:
     ```rust
     // Instead of: assert_eq!(result.is_ok(), should_succeed, ...);
     // Use:
     match (should_succeed, result) {
         (true, Ok(_)) => (), // Expected success
         (false, Err(RemoteFileError::UnsupportedProtocol(proto))) => {
             assert_eq!(proto, "sftp"); // Or whatever protocol was expected
         },
         (expected, actual) => panic!("Expected success: {}, got: {:?}", expected, actual),
     }
     ```
   - Success: Tests verify specific error types, not just success/failure

   - File: `client/rpc/src/tests/remote_file_rpc_tests.rs`
   - Operation: Consider moving integration tests to unit tests or removing redundant ones
   - Details: Evaluate if test_local_path_handling provides value beyond unit tests
   - Success: Test suite streamlined without redundant coverage

5. **Rename fetch_metadata Method Across All Handlers**

   - File: `client/rpc/src/remote_file/mod.rs`
   - Operation: Rename trait method in RemoteFileHandler
   - Details:
     ```rust
     // Change: async fn fetch_metadata(&self, url: &Url) -> Result<(u64, Option<String>), RemoteFileError>;
     // To: async fn get_file_size(&self, url: &Url) -> Result<u64, RemoteFileError>;
     ```
   - Success: Method name accurately reflects its purpose

   - File: `client/rpc/src/remote_file/local.rs`, `http.rs`, `ftp.rs`
   - Operation: Update all implementations to match new trait signature
   - Details: Update method names and return only file size
   - Success: All handlers consistently implement renamed method

6. **Add Comment About Streaming Memory Efficiency Issue**

   - File: `client/rpc/src/lib.rs`
   - Operation: Add detailed comment before line 169 explaining memory efficiency issue
   - Details:
     ```rust
     // TODO: Optimize memory usage for large file transfers
     // Current implementation loads all chunks into memory before streaming to remote location.
     // This can cause memory exhaustion for large files.
     // 
     // Proposed solution: Implement true streaming by:
     // 1. Create a custom Stream implementation that reads chunks on-demand
     // 2. Pass this stream directly to the remote handler
     // 3. This would allow chunks to be read from source and written to destination
     //    without buffering the entire file in memory
     //
     // Example approach:
     // - Create ChunkStream that implements Stream<Item = Result<Bytes, Error>>
     // - Read chunks from file_data_trie as they're pulled by the consumer
     // - This enables true streaming with constant memory usage
     ```
   - Success: Clear documentation of limitation and proposed solution

7. **Clean Up Outdated and Confusing Comments**

   - File: `client/rpc/src/remote_file/factory.rs`
   - Operation: Remove or update contradictory comments around line 101
   - Details:
     ```rust
     // Remove comment "// Don't check parent directory existence here"
     // Since the code does check if parent.exists()
     // Update logic to be consistent with comment or remove comment
     ```
   - Success: Comments accurately reflect code behavior

   - File: `client/rpc/src/remote_file/factory.rs`
   - Operation: Clean up unused for_write flag logic around line 55
   - Details: Remove any references to for_write parameter that's no longer used
   - Success: No dead code or unused parameters

   - File: `client/rpc/src/remote_file/ftp.rs`
   - Operation: Remove redundant test documentation comments
   - Details: Remove obvious comments like "This is pretty clear from the docs above"
   - Success: Only valuable comments remain

             let host = url.host_str()
                 .ok_or_else(|| RemoteFileError::InvalidUrl("No host in URL".to_string()))?
                 .to_string();
             let port = url.port().unwrap_or(21);
             let username = (!url.username().is_empty()).then(|| url.username().to_string());
             let password = url.password().map(|p| p.to_string());
             let path = url.path().to_string();
             
             Ok(Self { config, host, port, username, password, path })
         }

         status => Err(RemoteFileError::HttpError(
             format!("Unexpected status: {}", status)
         )),
     }
     
     async fn handle_full_content(response: Response) -> Result<...> {
         // Implementation
     }
     
     async fn handle_partial_content(response: Response, offset: u64) -> Result<...> {
         // Implementation with parse_content_range_header helper
     }
     
     fn parse_content_range_header(header: &str) -> Result<(u64, u64), RemoteFileError> {
         // Extract parsing logic here
     }
     ```

              }
          }
      }
      ```
    - Success: Chunk size configurable instead of hardcoded

    - File: `client/rpc/src/remote_file/ftp.rs`
    - Operation: Use config.chunk_size instead of hardcoded value
    - Details: Replace hardcoded buffer sizes with self.config.chunk_size
    - Success: Consistent use of configured chunk size

### Testing Strategy

- [ ] Run `cargo test` to ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Run `cargo clippy` to verify no new warnings introduced
- [ ] Test remote file operations with HTTP, FTP, and local files
- [ ] Verify memory usage doesn't grow linearly with file size (for streaming test)
- [ ] Load test with concurrent file operations

### Rollback Plan

Each change is atomic and can be reverted independently using git. If issues arise:
1. Revert specific commits addressing individual review comments
2. The original functionality remains intact as these are mostly improvements
3. No database migrations or breaking API changes involved
