# WIP: Mock PostgreSQL Implementation Status

## Current State
The mock PostgreSQL implementation has been temporarily commented out while we work on properly implementing the diesel traits. The architecture is in place but the implementation is incomplete.

## What's Done
1. **Architecture**: Connection abstraction layer with `DbConnection` trait
2. **Enum Dispatch**: `AnyDbConnection` and `AnyAsyncConnection` enums to handle trait object safety
3. **Mock Structure**: `MockDbConnection` and `MockAsyncConnection` with test data storage
4. **Error Simulation**: Mock error configuration for testing various failure scenarios
5. **RPC Mocks**: The RPC mock implementation is complete and working

## What's Needed
To make the mock PostgreSQL implementation work with the real `PostgresClient`, we need to implement several diesel traits on `MockAsyncConnection`:

1. **`diesel_async::AsyncConnection`** - Partially implemented
   - Need proper transaction handling
   - Need query execution support

2. **`diesel::connection::LoadConnection`** - Started but incomplete
   - Need to intercept queries and return mock data
   - Current implementation returns empty cursors

3. **Transaction Manager** - Basic structure exists
   - Need proper transaction state management
   - Current implementation is mostly no-ops

4. **Query Interception** - Not implemented
   - Need to parse diesel queries and return appropriate mock data
   - This is the most complex part

## Files Affected
- `/backend/lib/src/data/postgres/mock_connection.rs` - Main mock implementation (exists but commented out in mod.rs)
- `/backend/lib/src/data/postgres/connection.rs` - References to MockDbConnection commented out
- `/backend/lib/src/data/postgres/mod.rs` - Mock module export commented out
- `/backend/bin/src/main.rs` - Mock usage commented out

## To Re-enable
1. Uncomment the mock module in `/backend/lib/src/data/postgres/mod.rs`
2. Uncomment MockDbConnection references in `/backend/lib/src/data/postgres/connection.rs`
3. Uncomment mock usage in `/backend/bin/src/main.rs`
4. Implement the missing diesel traits properly

## Alternative Approaches to Consider
1. **Use a real in-memory database** (e.g., SQLite) for testing
2. **Mock at a higher level** (service level instead of connection level)
3. **Use test containers** with real PostgreSQL for integration tests
4. **Create a simpler trait** between PostgresClient and diesel that's easier to mock

The current approach of mocking at the diesel connection level is the most thorough but also the most complex due to diesel's extensive trait system.
