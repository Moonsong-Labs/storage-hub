 * 1. Seals a block
 * 2. Checks for the fisherman log message (with short timeout)
 * 3. If not found, waits and repeats
 * 4. Once found, optionally verifies extrinsics in tx pool
 *
 * If `expectExt` is provided, this function will verify that the expected
 * number of extrinsics are present in the transaction pool before returning.
 *
 * If `sealBlock` is true, a block will be sealed after verifying extrinsics
 * and the result (with events) will be returned.
 * Defaults to false to allow manual block sealing in tests.
 *
 * @returns When sealBlock is true, returns the sealed block result with events.
 *          When sealBlock is false, returns undefined.
