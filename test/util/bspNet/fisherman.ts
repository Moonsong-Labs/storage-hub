 * This handles the alternating User/Incomplete deletion cycle timing issue
 * where fisherman might be on the wrong cycle when deletions are created.
 *
 * The function uses a polling loop that:
 * 1. Seals a block
 * 2. Checks for the fisherman log message (with short timeout)
 * 3. If not found, waits and repeats
 * 4. Once found, optionally verifies extrinsics in tx pool
 *
 * If `expectExt` is provided, this function will verify that the expected
 * number of extrinsics are present in the transaction pool before returning.
 *
 * If `sealBlock` is true, a block will be sealed after verifying extrinsics.
 * Defaults to false to allow manual block sealing in tests.
