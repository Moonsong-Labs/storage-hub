# Enhanced Indexer-Lite Test Summary

## Created Tests

### 1. `indexer-lite-bucket-transfer.test.ts`
**Purpose**: Tests bucket transfer functionality in enhanced lite mode

**Key Test Cases**:
- ✅ Indexes bucket transferred from MSP2 to MSP1
- ✅ Indexes bucket transferred from MSP1 to MSP2  
- ✅ Tracks multiple bucket transfers (User → MSP2 → MSP1)
- ✅ Indexes MoveBucketRequested events from any MSP
- ✅ Maintains database integrity with cross-MSP references

**Coverage**: This comprehensively tests the bucket transfer scenarios mentioned in the plan.

### 2. `indexer-lite-bsp-tracking.test.ts`
**Purpose**: Tests BSP volunteering and file association tracking

**Key Test Cases**:
- ✅ Indexes BSP volunteering for files in MSP1's bucket
- ✅ Indexes multiple BSPs volunteering for the same file
- ✅ Indexes BSP volunteering for files in transferred buckets
- ✅ Provides complete BSP peer information for buckets
- ✅ Verifies bsp_file table integrity

**Coverage**: Fully covers BSP tracking requirements including the bsp_file table population.

### 3. `indexer-lite-performance.test.ts`
**Purpose**: Verifies no significant performance regression

**Key Test Cases**:
- ✅ Handles high volume of bucket and file creation efficiently
- ✅ Maintains query performance with large datasets
- ✅ Handles concurrent BSP volunteering efficiently
- ✅ Monitors indexer resource usage
- ✅ Verifies no data loss with enhanced mode

**Coverage**: Addresses performance concerns and validates the enhanced mode doesn't introduce significant overhead.

## Additional Tests Still Needed

### 1. Cross-MSP Integrity Test (mentioned in plan but not fully implemented)
While basic integrity is tested, we could add a dedicated test for:
- Creating minimal MSP records when processing events for unknown MSPs
- Handling bucket transfers from MSPs that haven't been seen before
- Verifying foreign key constraints are maintained

### 2. Migration Test (mentioned in plan but not implemented)
Need to create `indexer-lite-migration.test.ts` to test:
- Migration from old lite mode data to enhanced lite mode
- Verify existing data remains intact
- Test indexer restart scenarios with enhanced mode enabled

### 3. Move Bucket Event Coverage Test
While basic move bucket events are tested, could add more comprehensive testing for:
- MoveBucketRejected events
- MoveBucketRequestExpired events
- Complex move bucket scenarios with rejections and retries

## Test Execution Considerations

1. **Test Order**: These tests should run after basic indexer-lite tests to ensure the foundation is solid.

2. **Test Environment**: All tests use `describeMspNet` with `indexerMode: "lite"` which ensures MSP1 runs the indexer in lite mode.

3. **Timing**: Tests include appropriate `sleep()` calls to allow the indexer to process events before verification.

4. **Database Queries**: Tests use direct SQL queries to verify both domain tables (bucket, file, bsp_file) and event tables.

## Key Assertions Validated

1. **Bucket Transfers**:
   - All buckets are indexed regardless of ownership
   - Files remain indexed when buckets are transferred
   - Transfer events are properly tracked

2. **BSP Tracking**:
   - AcceptedBspVolunteer events are indexed
   - BspConfirmedStoring events are indexed
   - bsp_file table correctly associates BSPs with files
   - BSP peer IDs are available for querying

3. **Performance**:
   - No significant slowdown with increased event indexing
   - Query performance remains acceptable
   - Indexer keeps up with block production

4. **Data Integrity**:
   - No orphaned records
   - Foreign key constraints satisfied
   - Complete data visibility maintained

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all enhanced lite mode tests
pnpm test:node -- indexer-lite-bucket-transfer
pnpm test:node -- indexer-lite-bsp-tracking  
pnpm test:node -- indexer-lite-performance

# Or run with filter
FILTER="indexer-lite-bucket-transfer" pnpm test:node:single
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement the migration test to ensure smooth upgrades
2. Add more edge case testing for complex scenarios
3. Consider adding benchmarking data to track performance over time
4. Document any configuration changes needed for enhanced lite mode
