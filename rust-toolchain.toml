# Rust 1.90 is required due to polkadot-sdk stable2503 compatibility.
# Rust 1.91+ breaks pallet-revive-fixtures compilation with error:
#   "target-pointer-width: invalid type: string '64', expected u16"
# This is because polkavm-linker generates target specs with "target-pointer-width": "64" (string),
# but Rust 1.91 (PR #144443) changed this to require an integer: "target-pointer-width": 64.
# polkadot-sdk stable2503 was tested with Rust 1.84.1; 1.90 is the latest compatible version.
