/// A trait bundle that ensures a runtime API includes all storage-related capabilities.
///
/// This trait acts as a "capability bundle" that groups together all runtime APIs required
/// for StorageHub's storage operations. It provides a single trait bound that guarantees
/// access to all necessary storage subsystem APIs, simplifying client-side service implementations.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// Instead of requiring multiple trait bounds on every function or struct that needs to
/// interact with the storage runtime, this trait provides a single, comprehensive bound
/// that ensures all storage-related APIs are available.
///
/// # Usage Patterns
///
/// ## In Service Definitions
/// ```ignore
/// pub struct BlockchainService<RuntimeApi>
/// where
///     RuntimeApi::RuntimeApi: StorageEnableApiCollection,
/// {
///     // Service implementation
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## In Function Signatures
/// ```ignore
/// fn spawn_blockchain_service<RuntimeApi>(client: Arc<ParachainClient<RuntimeApi>>)
/// where
///     RuntimeApi::RuntimeApi: StorageEnableApiCollection,
/// {
///     // Can now use all storage APIs: FileSystemApi, StorageProvidersApi, etc.
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## In RPC Setup
/// ```ignore
/// pub fn create_full<C>(client: Arc<C>) -> RpcModule<()>
/// where
///     C::Api: StorageEnableApiCollection,
/// {
///     // RPC methods can access all storage runtime APIs
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Included APIs
///
/// - [`TransactionPaymentRuntimeApi`]: For fee calculations and payment handling
/// - [`AccountNonceApi`]: For transaction nonce management
/// - [`BlockBuilder`]: For block construction operations
/// - [`ProofsDealerRuntimeApi`]: For storage proof challenges and verification
/// - [`FileSystemRuntimeApi`]: For file operations and bucket management
/// - [`StorageProvidersRuntimeApi`]: For BSP/MSP provider operations
/// - [`PaymentStreamsRuntimeApi`]: For payment stream management
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// This trait has a blanket implementation for any type that implements all the
/// required runtime APIs. This means runtime developers don't need to explicitly
/// implement this trait - it's automatically available when all component APIs
/// are implemented.

///
/// Transaction extensions are used to attach additional data to transactions and perform

/// - Methods to generate implicit data required by the extension
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `Call`: The runtime call type that this extension validates
/// - `Hash`: The block hash type used for mortality and genesis checks
///
/// # Required Traits
///
/// Implementers must also implement `TransactionExtension<Call>` which provides the core
