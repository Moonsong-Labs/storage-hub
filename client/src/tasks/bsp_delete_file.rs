///   - Triggered when a specific file stop-storing confirmation has been finalised on-chain for this BSP.
///     The file is removed from File Storage if it is not present in the BSP's Forest Storage. If the key
///     is still present in the Forest Storage, it sends out a warning, since it could indicate that the
///     same file key was added again after being deleted by this BSP.
/// - **[`FinalisedTrieRemoveMutationsApplied`] Event:**
///   - Triggered when provider-wide Forest mutations have been finalised on-chain. This task only processes
///     remove mutations, checking each affected key and removing it from File Storage if it is not present
///     in the BSP's Forest Storage. If the key is still present, it logs a warning, since this could indicate
///     that the key has been re-added after being deleted.
///
/// This task performs the following actions:
/// - For each removed file key:
///   - Checks if the file key is present in the BSP's Forest Storage.
///     - If the key is still present, it logs a warning,
///       since this could indicate that the key has been re-added after being deleted.
