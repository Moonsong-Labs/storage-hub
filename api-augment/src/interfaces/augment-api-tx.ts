       * a. Checks that a payment stream between the signer (Provider) and the User exists
       * b. If there is a fixed-rate payment stream:
       * 1. Get the rate of the payment stream
       * 2. Get the difference between the last charged tick number and the last chargeable tick number of the stream
       * 3. Calculate the amount to charge doing `rate * difference`
       * 4. Charge the user (if the user does not have enough funds, it gets flagged and a `UserWithoutFunds` event is emitted)
       * 5. Update the last charged tick number of the payment stream
       * c. If there is a dynamic-rate payment stream:
       * 1. Get the amount provided by the Provider
       * 2. Get the difference between price index when the stream was last charged and the price index at the last chargeable tick
       * 3. Calculate the amount to charge doing `amount_provided * difference`
       * 4. Charge the user (if the user does not have enough funds, it gets flagged and a `UserWithoutFunds` event is emitted)
       * 5. Update the price index when the stream was last charged of the payment stream
